This is my workspace for everything related to STAR. The idea is to be able to work from all of my machines without relying on sshfs for the I/O.

The code here contains libraries within the StRoot framework, which I have used for my D0Analysis.

1. AuAu -> Code to maintain D0 Jets in Au-Au 200 GeV STAR
2. pp -> Code to maintain D0 Jets in p-p 200 GeV STAR
3. SimulationAuAu -> Code to simulate Run14 Geometry with HFT and run PYTHIA events through STARSIM
4. Simulationpp -> Code to simulate Run12 Geometry (Still in progress, waiting on TOF issue from Jason)
