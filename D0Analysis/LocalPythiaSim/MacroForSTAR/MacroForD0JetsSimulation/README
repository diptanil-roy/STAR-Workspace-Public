This macro can serve as the guideline for the Simulation Sample requested by JetCorr for Heavy Flavor Jets Study.
I do not expect the macro to run out-of-the-box on any system, as the system dependent paths for FASTJET and PYTHIA might need to be altered, or at least set globally.

PYTHIA here is OUT-OF-THE-BOX, but for our simulation, we request for the STAR Tune PYTHIA8.

To run (with the proper paths put in), one should be able to just run 'root -l RunMacro.C'.

There are two vertex files in the VERTEXFULL folder, which I created from the PicoDst Files. 
For example, 'Vertex_st_physics_15094070_raw_1000002.txt' is created from the PicoDst file 'root://xrdstar.rcf.bnl.gov:1095//home/starlib/home/starreco/reco/AuAu_200_production_mid_2014/ReversedFullField/P16id.SL18f/2014/094/15094070/st_physics_15094070_raw_1000002.picoDst.root'.

If you are using .daq files for the vertices, then that section needs to be repurposed.

The macro generates two files. The .root file is for QA on the jets, and contains basic info on the jets formed, and the D0s.
The .txt file serves as the input to GEANT.
