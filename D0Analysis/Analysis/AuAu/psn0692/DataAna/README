This is the Data analysis code for run14 HFT D0 spectra.
The input files are PicoDst produced with SL16d library.

Before you run, there is a technic issue with the StRefmutCor class, it can;t be commit this directory to CVS.
So you need to manual copy it from next directory to your StRoot
/star/u/xgn1992/work/CodeQA/offline/paper/psn0692/DataAna/StRoot/StRefMultCorr

==========================================
To test the code, following the next steps. It will take ~15mins
------------------------------------------
starver SL16d
cons
./runMixtest.sh


==========================================
To run the full data samples, the script shown below. It will take +++weeks with current pdsf cpu source.
So, we provide the final output files for you here with name :: D0_Data_Mix_MergeUsed.root
------------------------------------------
please skip this step with large data sample
