This is the data-driven simulation package used for the D0 efficiency calculation

==========================================
To test the code, following the next steps. It will take ~minute to produce a small tree
==========================================
starver SL16d
./runTest.sh


==========================================
To run with a large simulation samples, the script shown below. It will take +++Days with current pdsf cpu source.
==========================================
please skip this step, instead the output files can be found here : D0.list with 44G data
==========================================
./submit_qsub.sh 1e7 D0 0 20
==========================================


==========================================
To analysis the data-drive fast simu output root files, and extract the D0 rc efficiency
follow the next steps:
==========================================
cd ./ana
starver SL16d
make
./anaToyMcD0 D0.test.list test.root
==========================================
with a large data sample, just change with the input file D0.list
./anaToyMcD0 D0.list D0_eff.root
==========================================
please skip the very last step, The output was here: D0_eff_combine_newPID_newCuts_extendpT_1108.root
==========================================
