This is all the related analysis code for the run14 HFT D0 spectra.
For STAR note number : psn0692

Since the PicoDst and Embedding data are located on PDSF. So the code should be test and run on PDSF with STAR library SL16d.

There are 5 invidual folds, each of them are for different purpose as discussed below.

==========================================
1 ./DataAna:
------------
This is pico Analysis code, run with mix-event method to reconstruct D0 candidate.
Plese follow the README file inside that directory to test.

==========================================

2 ./Embedding:
------------
This is single track embedding code, extract the single track tpc tracking efficiency for k/pi
Plese follow the README file inside that directory to test.

==========================================

3 ./Efficiency:
------------
This is our data-dreiven fast-simulation package, for the D0 efficiency study
Plese follow the README file inside that directory to test.

==========================================

4 ./Analysis:
------------
This is the following analysis code to extract the D0 yield, systematic uncertatinties, RAA and Rcp calculations and so on.
Plese follow the README file inside that directory to test.

==========================================

5 ./MkPlots:
------------
This is the following code to make the Spectra, RAA and Rcp plots.
Plese follow the README file inside that directory to test.
