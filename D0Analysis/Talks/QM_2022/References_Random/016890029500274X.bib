abstract = {Bayes' theorem offers a natural way to unfold experimental distributions in order to get the best estimates of the true ones. The weak point of the Bayes approach, namely the need of the knowledge of the initial distribution, can be overcome by an iterative procedure. Since the method proposed here does not make use of continuous variables, but simply of cells in the spaces of the true and of the measured quantities, it can be applied in multidimensional problems.}
