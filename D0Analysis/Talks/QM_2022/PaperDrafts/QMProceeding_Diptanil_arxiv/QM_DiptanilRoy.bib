abstract = {The first measurement of jet shapes, defined as the fractional transverse momentum radial distribution, for inclusive jets produced in heavy-ion collisions is presented. Data samples of PbPb and pp collisions, corresponding to integrated luminosities of 150 μb−1 and 5.3 pb−1 respectively, were collected at a nucleon–nucleon centre-of-mass energy of sNN=2.76 TeV with the CMS detector at the LHC. The jets are reconstructed with the anti-kT algorithm with a distance parameter R=0.3, and the jet shapes are measured for charged particles with transverse momentum pT>1 GeV/c. The jet shapes measured in PbPb collisions in different collision centralities are compared to reference distributions based on the pp data. A centrality-dependent modification of the jet shapes is observed in the more central PbPb collisions, indicating a redistribution of the energy inside the jet cone. This measurement provides information about the parton shower mechanism in the hot and dense medium produced in heavy-ion collisions.}

abstract = {Bayes' theorem offers a natural way to unfold experimental distributions in order to get the best estimates of the true ones. The weak point of the Bayes approach, namely the need of the knowledge of the initial distribution, can be overcome by an iterative procedure. Since the method proposed here does not make use of continuous variables, but simply of cells in the spaces of the true and of the measured quantities, it can be applied in multidimensional problems.}
